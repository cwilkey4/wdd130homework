      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The purpose of this site is to educate young adults on good nutrition and give them the resources and encouragement necessary to hone their skills in the kitchen. Meal plans, recipes, select ingredients, and kitchenware are some services we hope to offer. </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Our audience will consist of individuals from the age group of 17-27, with a specific focus on college-age students who are learning to provide their own meals. Their primary concerns will concern the price and time required by each meal, so we will need to plan a good fraction of our services around that. Our meals do not need to be elaborate; though we will need to focus on variety and hitting multiple food groups. Most recipes will be meant to feed one or last multiple days. Meal plans should focus on drawing from the same set of base ingredients with some variation.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page -- Let's Spice Up Your Kitchen!</h3>
      <p>
The purpose of this website is majorly to educate college-age individuals on matters of nutrition and encourage them to get their hands messy in the kitchen. As a business, it might want to offer kitchen kits – kitchenware and ingredients – and recipes that are relatively fast and simple (after all, students are often more likely to prioritize homework and fun activities over excessive time in the kitchen). 
      </p>
      <h4>Tasty Food -- Fast, Cheap, or Nutritious?</h4>
      <p>Those who visit this site will likely be hoping to find a wider variety of meals. Some will be students, others may even be looking out for someone else who will be or already is a student. Most young adults aren’t overly concerned about eating healthy; there’s a bigger concern toward time, cost, and whether or not it tastes good. It would be important to appeal to one or all of these while developing this site.</p>
      <h4>It's Fun!</h4>
      <p>It might be fun to have the hero picture change over to something people send in. There should be an emphasis on the fact that cooking can be fun, and it’s certainly worthwhile. No matter the benefits, if it’s not engaging, motivation to actually do it is severely stifled. If it’s fun, though, it will become a worthwhile investment.</p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Nutrition... Why? -- Page 2</h3>
      <p>
        Nutritional facts could be displayed majorly as “fun facts” on the website or in the recipe books; a similar thing could be done for shopping tips. Some pages may be dedicated toward the educational side of things altogether. Of course, since it is part of the mission to get young adults invested in nutrition, good nutrtional choices specific to that age group will be emphasized in addition to general concepts. It might be fun to implement a drama aspect to grab attention and make it more engaging to learn about.
      </p>
      <h4>General Facts -- Tips and Tricks</h4>
      <p>We’ll cover some general things (MyPlate, Nutrition Labels, and Shopping Tips and Tricks, for example. The first two are meant to be used as good guidelines for the general public, and the latter can help people be more aware of certain traps that retailers use to make their products more appealing). Digging in a little deeper means that we can also add a section for interesting facts or stories. Nutrition can have a drastic impact on someone’s health and lifestyle, so demonstrating it in such a fashion seems appropriate. It could be shown similarly to a news bulletin, or as a temporary fact that changed overtime.
      </p>
      <h4>Let's Get Personal/Diving Deeper</h4>
      <p>In addition, perhaps people could add their own experiences. It could increase awareness, for example, if someone who is diabetic shares how that has impacted their life. It would add a personal and emotional impact that info-dumping lacks. It will feel more real and relevant.</p>

      </ul>
      <h3>What's it Cost? -- Page 3</h3>
      <h4>Combos</h4>
      <p>
        This is a huge concern for college students, so it seems imperative to include costs here. They want to know the best deals. There could be basic kits – recipes, kitchenware, and ingredients all in one – that have a reduced cost when combined. The same could apply to certain combinations of spices or other ingredients. 
      </p>
      <h4>Fresh Foods, Coupons</h4>
      <p>Fresh foods may be difficult to supply through online services, so shopping suggestions will be used to substitute some ingredients. A partnership with certain companies might be beneficial, especially if coupons or other benefits can add extra incentive. 
      </p>
      <h4>Rentals</h4>
      <p>Renting may not be the best service when it comes to kitchenware, but it’s worth considering, especially when college students are likely to be moving in and out of dorms, which may encourage them to pack lightly and live somewhat minimalistically.
