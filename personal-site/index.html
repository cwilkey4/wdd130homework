                <p>Between work, homework, and tuition, mealtime is usually downgraded to whatever is fast and cheap. Convenient? Yes. Unhealthy? Maybe a bit. Boring and repetitive? <i>Absolutely yes.</i> </p>
                <p>Here, our hope is to encourage students through an online medium to get a little more creative and nutritious with what they eat while working with these limitations.</p>
                <p>Here you'll find meal plans with simple recipes, a basic dietary education, and a means of getting ingredients and supplies onto your shelves!</p>
